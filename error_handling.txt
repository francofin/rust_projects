Rust groups errors to recoverable and unrecoverable errors. Recoverable rely on result type, unrecoverable look at th epanic macro. 
Panic macro terminates the current thread. An out of bounds access will cause a panic. Panic can also abort where unwinding does not abort. 
A Result Type allow us to prepare in case there is a failure. Result is an enum with 2 varibales Ok and err. 
File handling returns a result. 

We can use ErrKind. Unwrap is another tool.
With unwrap. If ok is returnes, it returns value of OK. But if error it calls panic. 
expect alllows us to customize errors.

 We can propagate the errror up the call stack. use a ? operator. On any expressuin that produces a result. on Ok unwraps result to get success value, on error immediately returns and passes up
 The rename method can rename file.

 cfg is configuration, only include the following for a certain situation. 

 asset_eq! makes sure the lhs is rhs
 the assert macrois used to make sure a func evaluatest to true
 We can also do assert_ne!
