Ints implements copy so we can either create a copy or use a reference if copy is not available on the data type. 
TO shuffle a vector we need to add rand to our dependecnies in cargo toml. 

Binary Heap a collections whose elements are kept loosely organized. Greatest value bubbles up to front. Usually push, pop and peek methods. 
Sorts the collection with the largest value at the top.
peek is similar to pop, but instead of getting a returned value and removing, it leaves the value there but returns the value. Also returns an Option<T>, None or Some(T)


Map collection key pair values. There are HashMaps and BTreeMaps.
HashMaps stored in a single heap memory allocation, bTreeMaps, in atreelike structure growing top down into nodes. 
Duplicate keys just end up updateing the old value to new value and actually returns the old value.This is also an optionof <T>

use the contains_key method to see if a key exist must be a ref. Returns a boolean.
The .get method returns the value of the key which is an Option of <T>

We also havbe a remove method which removes the key. Returns also an Option<T>
remove_entry removes the pair value, so returns the kley and value.

Sets can check if a value exist and does not contain duplicate. Sets only have keys and not key pair values. 
There are also HashSet and BtreeSet. 

We have an intersection method with 2 sets, to see which values are in both sets.  We also have union, returns values in first and or second hashset. method is .union(HASHET) i.e both sets without dups
