Shadowing is just creating new variables with the same name. Not the best idea. 

SIgned integers can hold positive and negative values. i32 for example. 
Can also use u8 or u32, unsinged integers that can only be positive. max value for u8 is 2**8-1. (255)
For i8 it is -2**7 to 2**7-1.

let sys_num: isize = -10;
let sys_num2: usize = 10;

isize and usize, depends on operating sys. 32 bit operating sys, isize is i32. 
Hexideciaml is 0-9 and a-f It works in the base 16 system. so 16 to power of x
byte numbers use UTF encoding. 

Stack
After compilation, files are just a sequence of bytes. 
xxd -g1 main to see what the file looks like. 
With cargo run, the the os is giving the program access to the memory. A program is just a process. 

We get memory from the OS. 
Memory has a read only section that reads the code. Memory has the stack which executes functions. Variables with static size. 
The heap can store more things. Sequence of bytes loaded in code memeory as executed. 
As program runs, stack stores variables and functions. 

Memeory allocates stack frame for the main function The stack pointer points to the top of the stack.
Each function gets a stack frame created and loaded, this shifts the stack pointer. 

On the stack we can only add values that are fixed size, where we know how much memory it will require. 
Strings are not static size, so are stored differently. 
Strings would be stored in the heap memory and a pointer to the location in the stack. 
The pointer is stored along with capacity and length of string. This pointer is the space for the address. Capacity is just a number. 
Capacity, is how much space is allocated. 

When we re assign values that are stored on the heap, we are actually copying the po
Dynamic variables are moved. 
Primitive types get stored on the stack so thats why it can be accessed again and does not need borrowiing. 

Copying happens with static values. References can be created. 
References are created with the &<variable>

let message = String::from("Hello World");
let message2: &String = &message;

References are essentially the pointer to the underlying owner of the data, whcih points to the actual data. 
The references is just removed from the stack. Refence is a pointer that does not own the data. The owner of the data is essentially th esmart pointer. 
We must mark the owner as mutable if we want to mutate the reference that owns the data. And specify that the type of the reference is mutable.

Keep in mind my mutating the reference, we also mutate the smart pointer. THus the smart pointer is not mutated with the data initialized by the reference pointer. 
Pointers have a drop function that removes the underlying memory of the dynamic type.
Mutating through the reference results in a process of derewferencing. 

let mut message = String::from("Hello World");
let message2: &mut String = &mut message;

println!("{}", message);
println!("{}", message2); Error


println!("{}", message2);
println!("{}", message); Correct

We cannot have a mutable borrow after an immutable borrow. We do not know which operation happens first. This just assures that we return what we want. 
Immutable references must follow mutable references to ensure data integrity. 

Dereference. 

Rust applies * to a reference so we can dereference from the original variable. 
e.g push_str is only applied to String. Thw * dereferences the variable accesses the owner of the data itself. 

let a = 10;
let b = &a;
let mut c = &b;
let d = b;

let e = &&100;
c = e;

If we want to see the value of a pointer we can look at {:p} where p implies the pointer to the variable. 
&mut(**e)


String vs &str.

Where as String has the pointer, capacity and length, &str only has the pointer and length but we cannot change the capacity. 
The &str however only points to the readonly part of the memory. 
We cannot mutate the &str. 


fn main() {
    let mut message = String::from("hello");
    let name = "Jack";

    message.push_str(" World");

}

A slice actually just points to the index of the actual data of the slice. Keep in mind the issue when the data itself goes out of scope. 
Clone creates new resources as it reallocates heap memory for the new variable. 
It takes a bit more memory however. 

Box type
Used to store data in the heap. If we want to place prim types on the heap
A box is essentially a pointer that points to the heap. 
Rust does not have objects and classes.


Structs
Boxes are structs. 
Instances cannot access the functions implemented but the struct can access this 
functions that do nto take self, are not available on the instance of the struct. 
We should include a reference to self and not self itself that way it is not moved once the method is complete. 
new creates default , from we must supply the constructor agrs. 
struct Person{
    name:String,
    age: i32,
    profession:String,
}

fn main() {
    let num = 32; on stack
    let num2 = Box::new(100); on heap.
}

impl Person {

    fn new() -> Self{
        Self {
            name:"default".to_owned(),
            age: 0,
            profession: "default".to_owned(),
        }
    }

    fn from(name: String, age:i32, profession:String) -> Person{
        Person{
            name,
            age,
            profession,
        }
    }


    fn some_function() {
        println!("Some Function");
    }

    fn display_age(&self){
        //note in background rust is actually doing self: &Self
        //this is a method
        println!("{}", self.age);
    }

    fn change_age(&mut self, new_age: i32){
        self.age = new_age;
    }
}


let mut person = Person{
    name:"Michael Jackson".to_owned(),
    age:50,
    profession: "Singer Songwriter".to_owned(),
};

person.change_age(330);

let mut person2 = Person::new();

person2.change_age(500);

let mut person3 = Person::from(
    String::from("John"),
    35,
    String::from("Lancaster"),
);

person3.change_age(500);
